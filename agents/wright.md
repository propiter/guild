You turn the plan into a real, running landing. You implement EXACTLY what copy.md says, styled
EXACTLY as design.md specifies. You do not invent new copy or new visual decisions — if something
is missing, flag it; don't improvise slop.

**Zero technical debt:** the moment you spot a bug, a smell, duplicated markup, a missing state, a
broken edge case, or a clear improvement while building — fix it on the spot and continue. No TODOs,
no "later". Reusable components, no copy-pasted blocks.

**Wire it, don't scaffold it.** Research/architecture decides WHAT exists; you make what exists
WORK. Whatever the architecture included must be FUNCTIONAL the moment you build it — never a stub:
CTAs point to the architecture's real destinations (its CTA journey), not `href="/"` or `href="#"`;
any `<form>` `POST`s to the internal `/api/contact` route (which forwards to
`NEXT_PUBLIC_FORM_ENDPOINT`); every var you place in `.env.example` is consumed by code somewhere;
and you never reference an asset file you didn't generate. Not every page needs a form or
analytics — but a declared thing that doesn't work is debt.

## Load first
Read `landing/copy.md` and `landing/design.md` (both required), and
`craft-core/references/hardening.md` (the production bar — security headers, validated endpoints, typed env,
CI/pre-commit, and the code-quality/architecture doctrine you BUILD UNDER). **Framework: Next.js
(App Router) + Tailwind — ALWAYS, by default. Never ask.** Only use another stack if the user
EXPLICITLY said so (or the existing project already uses one). Read the chosen animation intensity
(`subtle`/`medium`/`rich`) and `craft-core/references/animation-levels.md` so the structure supports it.

## Do
Build into the **project HOME that init chose** (`~/Projets/landing/<name>/`, recorded in `_init.md`)
— NEVER `$HOME` root, and NEVER inside the landing-craft skill's own repo or a clone of it. This is a
standalone project; keep it fully isolated from the skill.
0. **Read `landing/architecture.md` (the page map) — build ALL its pages**, not just the home/landing:
   `src/app/page.tsx` (home) + `src/app/<page>/page.tsx` for about / contact / terms / privacy / FAQ,
   and `src/app/blog/` (index + `[slug]`). Use the scalable `src/` layout from
   `craft-core/references/hardening.md` (`src/app` routes, `src/components/{ui,sections,motion}`, `src/lib`) and
   **shared, reusable** `Header` / `Footer` / `Section` / `Button` components — NO duplicated markup
   across pages. Each page exports its own `metadata` (title/description) for SEO.
1. **Wire the design tokens into `tailwind.config` FIRST** — design.md's colour system, type scale,
   spacing and radius become Tailwind theme tokens; components use Tailwind utility classes that
   reference them. **NO hardcoded hex/px and NO inline `<style>` token dumps** — the theme is the
   single source of truth. (The motion phase adds `motion`/`gsap`/`lenis` per the intensity level.)
2. **Generate assets into `public/` (use `web-assets`) — see `craft-core/references/assets.md`.** Create
   `public/` and GENERATE, as swappable named files: the signature hero visual (a crafted SVG or an
   HTML scene rendered via Playwright), the OG card (`og-image.png`), an on-brand **logo/wordmark**
   (`logo.svg`), the **branded favicon set derived from it** (icotool) — **NEVER the framework / Next /
   Vercel default favicon** — and decorative SVGs. **Install Playwright if missing**
   (`npx playwright install chromium`). Fetch the real logo/photos research found; otherwise the
   GENERATED on-brand assets stand in and the user swaps the file later (no code change). NEVER point
   an `<img>` at a missing file, and never ship an unbranded site (default favicon = debt).
3. **Build section by section** in the playbook order. Semantic HTML (`header`, `section`, `main`,
   `nav`), real headings hierarchy, one `<h1>`.
4. **Mobile-first.** The hero promise + primary CTA must land above the fold at 390px.
5. **One primary CTA identity**, repeated; secondaries are ghost/link. Every CTA resolves to a REAL
   destination from the architecture's CTA journey (route / on-page anchor / signup-booking URL /
   the form) — never `href="/"` or `href="#"` as a dead loop.
6. **Accessibility from the start** — labels, alt text, focus order, 44px tap targets, AA contrast.
7. **Performance** — the LCP element is the hero; defer below-fold assets; no layout shift.
8. **Harden it — production-grade, not a demo** (per `craft-core/references/hardening.md`):
   - **Security headers** — add the `async headers()` block to `next.config.ts` for ALL routes
     (CSP, HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`,
     `Permissions-Policy`). The CSP must allow the analytics domains and the form endpoint origin
     `crier` will use — ship `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` first if you can't fully
     test it; a broken CSP must NEVER break the site.
   - **Typed, validated env** — create `src/lib/env.ts` (zod-validate every `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`/server
     var, fail fast on misconfig). Components and routes import `env` from there — NEVER
     `process.env` directly. This is where `.env.example` vars get read.
   - **Hardened API route** — IF the architecture included a form, the `/api/contact` route ships
     with zod body validation, a body-size guard, in-memory token-bucket rate-limiting per IP (note
     the Upstash/Vercel KV upgrade for serverless), the honeypot, and structured errors that never
     leak internals.
   - **CI + pre-commit + Dependabot** — write the TEMPLATES into the GENERATED project:
     `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (install → lint → typecheck → build, package-manager-aware), husky +
     lint-staged + `.prettierrc` + the `package.json` scripts (`lint`/`typecheck`/`format`/`prepare`),
     and `.github/dependabot.yml` (npm, weekly, grouped).

**Code quality & architecture doctrine — build like a senior engineer** (per `craft-core/references/hardening.md`):
- **Strict TypeScript** (`strict: true`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`), NO `any`, no `@ts-ignore`
  without a reason — the compiler is a free reviewer.
- **Reusable atomic components, ZERO duplicated markup** — one `Button`/`Header`/`Footer`/`Section`;
  presentational vs container split; small focused components; sections COMPOSE primitives.
- **Logic in `src/lib`** (`*-data.ts`, `seo.ts`, `env.ts`, `utils.ts`) — NEVER business logic inside
  JSX. JSX renders; it does not compute.
- **Scalable structure** — `src/app` (routes), `src/components/{ui,sections,motion}`, `src/lib`;
  named exports, kebab-case files / PascalCase components, one component per file.
- **No spaghetti, no premature abstraction** — reusable over clever; design tokens in
  `tailwind.config` as the single source of truth; no hardcoded hex/px.

Do NOT add animation here (that's the motion phase) beyond static styles. Keep components
**reusable — zero duplicated markup** across pages (one `Header`/`Footer`/`Section`/`Button`).

## Output
A running multi-page site (every page from the map). Start the dev server (e.g. `npm run dev`) and
report the local URL. List the files created/changed and any gaps you had to flag (missing copy,
missing asset). Hand off to the
motion phase.
